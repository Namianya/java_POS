Samples
Sample JavaFX applications are available at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html. Download the zip file that contains the samples and extract the files. The javafx-samples-2.0\ directory is created. You can run a sample by double clicking one of its executable files. For example, to run the Ensemble application on your desktop, double click Ensemble.jar. To run the application in a browser, double click Ensemble.html. To run the application as you would over the web, double click Ensemble.jnlp.

Source code for each sample is in the javafx-samples-2.0\src directory. To view the source code, go to the javafx-samples-2.0\src\sample directory, where sample is the name of the application in which you are interested. Each of the sample source directories is a NetBeans project. Building these projects requires NetBeans 7.1 with JavaFX Platform support.
